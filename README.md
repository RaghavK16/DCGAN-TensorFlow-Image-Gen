* An implementation of DCGAN in Keras on Tensorflow backend, to generate high quality synthetic images.

* Important TensorFlow implementation codes in Python3, created while learning and using in TensorFlow-2.

* Dataset Used: [Fashion_MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

## Prerequisite

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the JupyterLab or the classic Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install jupyter.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
jupyter notebook
